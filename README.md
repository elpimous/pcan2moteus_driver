# pcan2moteus_driver

A driver for Peak FDCAN M2 4 can board, to interact with Moteus controllers

This code is for a PEAK M2 4 FDCan ports, each port listens to 3 ID's

There is a struct to help in ID's, ports, polarity controllers, regarding to software needs

This code is constantly being improved, and you can help here if you want (syntax, memory leaks...)

Hope it will help you.

Thanks to Josh Pieper (MJBOTS) and Gennaro Raiola (Whole-body Locomotion Framework for quadruped robots) for their invaluable assistance.
Thanks too to chat gpt4 for tips, codes...(my personal teacher)
